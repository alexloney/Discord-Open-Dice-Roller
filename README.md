# Discord-Open-Dice-Roller
I enjoy playing RPGs such as D&D from Discord, but I ran into the issue where I 
needed a nice roller for everyone to to utilize while playing. Before beginning 
on this project, I researched existing dice rollers for Discord. While some do
exist, they were all lacking in at lesat one area that I'd like to have.

* [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick) - By far my favorite that I've found so far, but it is not open source. Knowing how Discord bots work, they're hosted from external servers and we discuss potentially sensitive information on our server that I don't want a random bot to potentially see/record.
* [Discord-Dice-Roller-Bot](https://github.com/Chaithi/Discord-Dice-Roller-Bot) - Not enough functionality for what I needed.
* [EvilLogic's Dice-Bot](https://github.com/EvilLogic/Dice-Bot) - Also not enough functionality. Furthermore it seems to be limited to a single channel (probably because it does not use a token to parse commands out).
